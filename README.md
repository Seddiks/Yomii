# Yomii
Yomii is Travel application
This project is a mobile app dedicated to people who travel around the world, who sepurpose is to group them in a platform and create a social network for help each other to have more details on each destination (hotels, transportation, best places to visit .. etc.). For the moment I realized some steps such as: 
- Global interface, login and user registration, forgotten password recovery. 
- Take photo, single and multiple selection of photos, create multiple ﬁlters like (Hudson, Hefe, Valencia, Contrast, Sepia, Brightness..etc) to apply them on photos to share. 
- Adding Comments and Likes in shared photos. 
- Notiﬁcation System (notify the user if a comment or I like added in his shared photos ..)
